This project is a simple technical documentation page for HTML, aimed at providing a comprehensive guide for beginners to understand the core elements of HTML. The page includes a sidebar navigation menu for quick access to different sections such as HTML Basics, Inline Elements, HTML Forms, and HTML Media. Each section contains detailed explanations and examples to help users grasp HTML concepts like headings, paragraphs, forms, links, and multimedia embedding. This project serves as a great exercise in structuring content and creating interactive documentation for web development.
